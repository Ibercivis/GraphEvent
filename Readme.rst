Graphevent
==========
This is a facebook app to generate relationship graphics based on
facebook events, released as a facebook app, almost using
only javascript (php is required for the images proxy)
It's a nice example on the new facebook graph api and html5
canvas elements, also JIT is being used extremely here.
